    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Julienne is a popular dish of the Soviet restaurant cuisine.
        The name comes from the French term for cutting fresh veggies
        but eventually the term lost its original meaning. Julienne is
        made of mushrooms, cheese, and chicken to name the most
        important ingredients.
